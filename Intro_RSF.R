# Goals of the Analysis

#1. Import data and clean
#2. Visualize data, provide summary plots of movement - Interested to see how you do these two steps.  Happy to merge my code with yours
#3. Calculate Home range (MCP and AKDE) - I have code for this
#4. RSF analysis and potentially SSF (iSSF) analysis - This is intro, don't want to get to complicated
#     Start with a single animals
#     Integrate/extract a few data layers (Distance to woody cover, anthropogenic disturbance)
#     Build to multi-animal model
#     Start with simple RSF (logistic regression model).  I'd like to build a model with 2 or 3 varables and then ask students to construct a new model with an additional 1 or 2 variables.  I'd then like them to tell me which model is better.
#     Perhaps move to SSF (conditional logistic regression) or even iSSF, but I view this as much more advanced
#5. Animate Movements - I have code for this

# I am going to put all of this in a Markdown document as it develops and will credit you for your assistance

# In this example, we will use a dataset that I collected during my PhD research.  Data are freely available on Movebank:
# Stabach JA, Hughey LF, Reid RS, Worden JS, Leimgruber P, Boone RB (2020) Data from: Comparison of movement strategies of three populations of white-bearded wildebeest. Movebank Data Repository. doi:10.5441/001/1.h0t27719

# Do NOT open the file in Excel before loading it into R.  Excel will mess up the time stamp column and set it to the time on your computer, not what you want for most studies 
load("./Data/wildebeest.rda")
head(wild)
str(wild)

# Set TimeZone
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
TimeZone <- "Africa/Nairobi"

# Note that I am overwriting the timestamp field here (UTC)
wild$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(wild$study.local.timestamp, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz=TimeZone)

# Check your attributes
# It is essential that you are certain of your time zone
attr(wild$timestamp, "tzone")

# Note, you could have also taken the UTC time, created a POSIXct object and then converted to local time
# wild$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(wild$timestamp, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="UTC")
# wild$timestamp <- with_tz(wild$timestamp, "Africa/Nairobi")

# The lubridate has a number of useful functions for time, especially when reading data from a file when your system will assume a certain timezone.
# force_tz changes the time zone without changing the clock time.

# See also some of the manipulations you can do to your time stamp, especially when it is a character field
# I would recommend always specifying your TimeZone
#wild$test <- ymd_hms(wild$study.local.timestamp, tz = TimeZone)
#wild  <- wild %>% mutate(test = ymd_hms(study.local.timestamp, tz = TimeZone)) # Could use mutate to get the same result

# Movebank helps in resolving these issues because it standardizes the columns and formats.

# I had to first open the file in Excel to  Must fix the time, first by correcting the time in the Excel file
# I then needed to set the format of the time to POSIXct using lubridate
# Find the function that matches the format of your data


# There are extra columns in the data frame that we can immediately remove.  Not absolutely necessary to do, but helpful to simplify the dataset.

# Here the intercept decreases as the number of available points increases,
